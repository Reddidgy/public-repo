# Pre-push hook that automatically handles version bumping
#
# This hook intercepts git push and ensures version is bumped before pushing.
# The hook MUST consume stdin (push refs) and perform the complete push operation,
# so git/IDEA understands the push was handled and doesn't try again.

# Read and consume stdin (the push refs from git)
# This signals to git that we're handling the push
