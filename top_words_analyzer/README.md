This simple program can analyze a text file (such as a book) and count the occurrences of each word within it. After processing, the program generates an "out.txt" file that lists each word along with the number of times it appears.

It's a way to identify the most frequently used words in any book :)

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Open the "main.py" file.
2. Enter the filename and press "Enter" (you can use "harryPotter1.txt" in this folder or any other file).
3. The process may take some time and will provide you with a success message when it's finished.

**Optional Methods:**
- You can simply open the "out.txt" file, but it won't have any filtering applied.
- Alternatively, you can copy all the text and paste it into Google Sheets for further filtering :)

*P.S. I was learning English at the time, and the idea was to identify the most common English words to improve my vocabulary :P*
