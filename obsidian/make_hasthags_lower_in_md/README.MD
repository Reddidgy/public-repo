# Markdown File Processor

This Python script processes all Markdown files (with the extension '.md') in a specified directory and its subdirectories. The script replaces all '#' characters in the Markdown files with the same number of '#' characters in lowercase.

## How to Start

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository.
5. Modify the `process_directory()` function call at the end of the script, providing the path to the directory you want to process.
6. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will process all Markdown files in the specified directory and its subdirectories, converting '#' characters to lowercase.
